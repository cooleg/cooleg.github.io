            I have basic skills in python. Like basic. Ask me to write you a script that saves a file and I'll be done when clocks don't
            read in minutes anymore. 
            Also the same story with HTML and CSS. This website proves it. 
            I got stuck in tutorial hell unfortunately, but I am learning dart and the flutter framework right now and I am doing it hopefully 
            right. If I successfuly learned the androidiness of flutter correctly you should see an app on google play in the near future!
